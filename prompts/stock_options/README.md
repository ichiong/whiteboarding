# Stock Prices

__Whiteboard__: Harder

__Challenge__: Medium

----

This challenge, youâ€™ll return the maximum profit possible for buying-and-selling a stock.

The best function will be given a list of stock prices as they happened throughout the day:

```python
best([15, 10, 20, 22, 1, 9])
```

It should return the maximum possible profit on the stock for that day. For example, with these prices, our best option would have been to buy the stock at $10 and sell it at $22. So the profit would be $12:

```python
best([15, 10, 20, 22, 1, 9])
12
```

Best profit: $4 (buy at $1, sell at $5):

```python
best([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
4
```

Other tests:

```python
best([2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1])
8
```

```python
best([7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2])
2
```

```python
best([0, 100])
100
```

No profit is possible, so return $0:

```python
best([5, 4 ,3, 2, 1])
0
```

```python
best([100])
0
```

```python
best([100, 0])
0
```
